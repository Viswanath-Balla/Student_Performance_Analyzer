# Student_Performance_Analyzer
A web-based application to help professors and students track, analyze, and visualize academic performance efficiently.
## Project Overview:
The Student Performance Analyzer is a platform which is designed to help the student monitor their
academic performance. By tracking performance, and presenting it through interactive tables, graphs, and
charts, the platform offers a clear and visual representation of their progress through their course. Teachers
